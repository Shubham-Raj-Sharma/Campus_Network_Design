### Campus Network Design

### Introduction
This project involves designing and configuring a secure, scalable university network for Albion University using Cisco Packet Tracer. A hierarchical network topology connects two campuses with multiple buildings and faculties, each placed on separate IP networks using VLANs and subnetting. Inter-VLAN routing, router-based DHCP, RIPv2 dynamic routing, static routing to external cloud services, and switch port security are implemented to ensure efficient communication, security, and centralized network management across the university.
